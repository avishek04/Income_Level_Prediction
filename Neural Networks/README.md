# Machine Learning Homework-5

This directory consists of two code file - neuralNet.py and pyTorch.py.

neuralNet.py implements the following questions:

1. 2 (a)
2. 2 (b)
3. 2 (c)

Running the neuralNet.py code file will produce the output to the problem 2(b) and 2(c).
2(a) is implmented in the function named as "backProp" in the neuralNet.py code file.

To run the neuralNet.py code:

```script
./run1.sh
```

pyTorch.py implements the below question:

1. 2 (e)

Running the pyTorch.py code file will produce the output to the problem 2(e).

To run the pyTorch.py code:

```script
./run2.sh
```
